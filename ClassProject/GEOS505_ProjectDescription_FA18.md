# GEOS 505: Research Computing in Earth System Science
# Final Project Requirements

## Due Date: December 13, 2018 5:00 PM MT

## 1. Overview
The final project in GEOS 505 is meant to assess the extent to which you can effectively apply the knowledge and skills you have developed throughout the semester to a problem of interest to you. There are three fundamental goals of this project. They are to have you:
1. Identify a problem of interest that requires or can be made substantially easier by applying your scientific computing skills,
2. Demonstrate the ability to __independently__ extend your scientific computing knowledge and skills by, for example, using new Python libraries or more deeply exploring libraries with which you are already familiar, and
3. Document your problem, the approach you used to address it, and the outcomes of those efforts in a Jupyter notebook

## 2. Essential Project Elements
The final project has four essential elements:
1. A problem statement that identifies the science or engineering problem that needs to be solved, the required outcome of the problem, and the data sources available to help address the problem, 
2. An overview of the programming libraries and associated methods required to achieve the required outcomes 
3. A demonstration of a scientific computing workflow that uses the libraries and methods identified above to produce output (i.e., a derived dataset, a visualization) that solves the problem, in part or whole, and
4. A write-up, in the form of a Jupyter notebook, that summarizes the problem, data, methods and materials, and outcomes that can be posted to GitHub and shared with colleagues.

## 3. Timeline and Items Due
* __Due November 8__: A problem statement that clearly: (1) states the scientific or engineering problem to be solved and provides some rationale as to why that problem is important, (2) identifies the datasets to be used in the analysis or modeling exercise, and (3) articulates the required outputs and outcome of the analyses.
* __Due November 15__: A Jupyter notebook that provides an overview of the datasets to be used in the analysis. Any plots or visualizations should have all axes labeled (with units when appropriate), legends (when two or more datasets are plotted on the same axes), and should be of adequate resolution and size. 
* __Due November 29__: A Jupyter notebook that provides a progress update on the application of methods and techniques being developed and used in the analysis. This notebook should include both descriptive text describing *what* is being done and *why* it is being done, as well as visualizations or other derived products that illustrate these methods and techniques.
* __Due December 6__: A 4 minute, 6 slide (maximum) lightning talk that provides your colleagues with a brief overview of your project. The lightning talk should address the problem, the datasets being used, the analysis techniques and methods, and present any preliminary products. 
* __Due December 13__: A Jupyter notebook, posted to Github, that provides a summary of your project. Specifically, the notebook should be a mixture of both descriptive text, Python code, and associated output. It __must__ have the following sections: (1) Introduction and Problem Statement, (2) Data and Methods, (3) Results, and (4) Next Steps. 

## 4. Collaboration
Although you will work on independent projects that are individually defined, I strongly encourage you to collaborate with your colleagues throughout the project. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring clarity in the project definition and intended outcomes, helping to trouble-shoot with code, and providing key feedback regarding the effectiveness of graphics and visualization.

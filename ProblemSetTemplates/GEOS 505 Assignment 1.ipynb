    "### Purpose\n",
    "In this assignment you will demonstrate your emerging research computing competencies by: (1) obtaining some dataset that is relevant to your research or research interests, (2) importing that dataset into Python, (3) creating a visualization of that dataset and describing (in text) what is being shown, and (4) saving and uploading the Jupyter Notebook you created to your Github account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "Using this Jupyter notebook as a template, you should use a combination of code and Markdown cells to illustrate and describe the workflow you are using to import and visualize your dataset. The prompts below can serve as a roadmap for how this workflow should unfold."

    "You should include a detailed description of any cleaning or manipulation done to the data prior to reading it in here, why you needed to do it, and how you did it. You should also include a justification for how you read the data into Python using the command you did. Provide examples of other ways you could have read in the data and discuss why you chose not to use those methods."

Describe key features of the data that the outside reviewer should pay attention to. This might include a description of anything unanticipated that you see in the data, or a verification that the visualization shows what you expected to see. "

Use words to describe any additional analyses and why they are relevant."

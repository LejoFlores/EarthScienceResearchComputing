## Welcome and Vision

Welcome! My name is Lejo Flores and I am an Associate Professor in the Geosciences Department at Boise State University, and I will your learning coordinator and coach in this class. I am very excited that you are here.

My vision for this class is to prepare you to become a self-propelled researcher in the Earth and environmental sciences and engineering. We will achieve this by equipping you with important skills, competencies, and knowledge in the realm of scientific computing. Key facets of this skill- and knowledge-set include: (1) a degree of familiarity with a scientific computing language (we will use Python, although there are many other equivalently useful scientific languages), (2) an ability to effectively find, use, and document external resources to more rapidly solve scientific and engineering problems, (3) the capacity to use contemporary practices to ensure that your scientific programs and data are well-documented and reusable, and (4) an awareness of the national research computing ecosystem, particularly as it pertains to the Earth and environmental sciences.
